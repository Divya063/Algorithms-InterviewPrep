<hr>

<ol>
<li>Given an array reverse it.</li>
<li>Write recursive and iterative versions of a binary search in an array.</li>
<li>Given 2 arrays find an intersection of them.</li>
<li>Given a size n array that contains all integers from 0 to n-1. The elements are in random order, how do you sort it?</li>
<li>Write a function that accepts an n-dimension array and prints values for array of any dimension. What is the layout of multi-dimensional array in the memory?</li>
<li>Without using a shuffle or sort write your own shuffle method for an array. The method will take an array and returns a new array with all of the elements in a random order. One important property of a good shuffle method is that every permutation is equally likely.</li>
<li>An N sized array contains integers starting from 1. Find the first missing integer. For example, in [4, 1, 3, 2, 6]the first missing integer is 5.</li>
<li>Shift an array by k places.</li>
<li>Given a sorted array of 0’s and 1’s. Find out the no. of 0’s in it. Write recursive, iterative versions of the code.</li>

<h4>
<a name="string-compression" class="anchor" href="#string-compression"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>String Compression</h4>

<p>Implement a method to perform basic string compression using the counts of repeated characters.If the "compressed" string would not become smaller than the original string, your method should return the original string. </p>

<a name="remove-duplicate" class="anchor" href="#remove-duplicate"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Remove Duplicate</h4>

<p>Design an algorithm and write code to remove the duplicate characters in a string without using any additional buffer. 
NOTE: One or two additional variables are fine. An extra copy of the array is not. Write the test cases for this method.</p>

<h4>
<a name="generate-all-permutations-of-a-string" class="anchor" href="#generate-all-permutations-of-a-string"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Generate all permutations of a String</h4>

<h4>
<a name="replace-all-spaces" class="anchor" href="#replace-all-spaces"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Replace all spaces</h4>

<p>Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with '%20'. You may assume that the string has sufficient space at the end of the string to hold the additional characters, and that you are given the "true" length of the string. (Note: if implementing in Java, please use a character array so that you can perform this operation in place.) </p>

<h4>
<a name="reversing-words-within-a-string" class="anchor" href="#reversing-words-within-a-string"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Reversing words within a String</h4>

<p>Write a function that receives a string composed by words separated by spaces and returns a string where words appear in the same order but than the original string, but every word is inverted. 
Example, for this input string
@"the boy ran"
the output would be
@"eht yob nar"

<p>You’re to write a game to paint a snake on the screen. At every time interval, the player must move the head of the snake in any of the 3 directions (other than going backward), the body of the snake will move along. The game is over when the snake hits its own body or the screen boundary. Design the API and data structure to use.</p>

<h4>
<a name="implement-two-stacks-in-an-array" class="anchor" href="#implement-two-stacks-in-an-array"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Implement two stacks in an array</h4>

<p>Create a data structure twoStacks that represents two stacks. Implementation of twoStacks should use only one array, i.e., both stacks should use the same array for storing elements. Following functions must be supported by twoStacks.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>push1(int x) –&gt; pushes x to first stack </p>

<p>push2(int x) –&gt; pushes x to second stack</p>

<p>pop1() –&gt; pops an element from first stack and return the popped element</p>

<p>pop2() –&gt; pops an element from second stack and return the popped element</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Implementation of twoStack should be space efficient.</p>

<a name="find-the-first-circular-tour-that-visits-all-petrol-pumps" class="anchor" href="#find-the-first-circular-tour-that-visits-all-petrol-pumps"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Find the first circular tour that visits all petrol pumps</h4>

<p>Suppose there is a circle. There are n petrol pumps on that circle. You are given two sets of data.</p>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The amount of petrol that petrol pump will give.</li>
<li>Distance from that petrol pump to the next petrol pump.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Calculate the first point from where a truck will be able to complete the circle (The truck will stop at each petrol pump and it has infinite capacity). Expected time complexity is O(n). Assume for 1 litre petrol, the truck can go 1 unit of distance.
For example, let there be 4 petrol pumps with amount of petrol and distance to next petrol pump value pairs as {4, 6}, {6, 5}, {7, 3} and {4, 5}. The first point from where truck can make a circular tour is 2nd petrol pump. Output should be “start = 1″ (index of 2nd petrol pump).</p>

<p>Alternatively: design a stack using 2 queues</p>

<h4>
<a name="stack-with-max" class="anchor" href="#stack-with-max"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Stack with max</h4>

<p>Create a data structure that efficiently supports the stack operations (push and pop) and also a return-the-maximum operation. Assume the elements are real numbers so that you can compare them. </p>

<h4>
<a name="king-and-knight" class="anchor" href="#king-and-knight"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>King and Knight</h4>

<p>Given a king and a knight on an infinite chessboard (no boundary), each takes turn to move (i.e. the king moves first, then the knight can move, then the king moves again and so on). Find the minimum number of moves until they meet at the same square. What is the time and space complexity of your solution?</p>

<h4>
<a name="implement-peek-minmaxmiddle-on-a-stack" class="anchor" href="#implement-peek-minmaxmiddle-on-a-stack"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Implement Peek min/max/middle on a stack</h4>

<p>Add three additional methods to a generic stack data structure. Write a peek for the min, max and middle value. This should not change the original stack. Assume all items in the stack are of the same type or have a compare function for the respective language.</p>

<h4>
<a name="infix-to-postfix-conversion" class="anchor" href="#infix-to-postfix-conversion"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Infix to Postfix Conversion</h4>

<p>Given an expression in infix notation return it in postfix notation. An infix expression is one in which operators are located between their operands. In postfix notation, the operator immediately follows its operands. ‘X + Y’ becomes ‘XY+’ in postfix notation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Example</em>: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>3+4 → 3 4 +</p>

<p>(300+23)*(43-21)/(84+7) → 300 23 + 43 21 - * 84 7 + /</p>

<h4>
<a name="topological-sort" class="anchor" href="#topological-sort"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Topological sort</h4>

<p>Given a set of tasks and their dependency graph (i.e. edge (u, v)  means that task u depends on task v and must be completed after v; tasks can have multiple dependencies). Assume that there is no circular dependency, return an execution order of these tasks such that the dependencies are satisfied. </p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Example</em>: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Input: 1 =&gt; 2; 3=&gt;1; 2 =&gt; 4; 3=&gt;4</p>

<p>Output: 4, 2, 1, 3</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>Note: There can be many possible orders, just need to return one. The number of tasks &lt;= 10,000.</p>

<h4>
<a name="duplicate-parentheses" class="anchor" href="#duplicate-parentheses"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Duplicate parentheses</h4>

<p>Give an algorithm for finding duplicate parentheses in a expression. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>How to implement LRU caching scheme? What data structures should be used?
We are given total possible page numbers that can be referred. We are also given cache (or memory) size (Number of page frames that cache can hold at a time). The LRU caching scheme is to remove the least recently used frame when the cache is full and a new page is referenced which is not there in cache. </p>

<h4>
<a name="tower-of-hanoi" class="anchor" href="#tower-of-hanoi"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Tower of Hanoi</h4>

<p>In the classic problem of the Towers of Hanoi, you have 3 towers and N disks of different sizes which can slide onto any tower. The puzzle starts with disks sorted in ascending order of size from top to bottom (i.e., each disk sits on top of an even larger one). You have the following constraints:          </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Only one disk can be moved at a time.</p></li>
<li><p>A disk is slid off the top of one tower onto the next rod.</p></li>
<li><p>A disk can only be placed on top of a larger disk.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Write a program to move the disks from the first tower to the last using Stacks. </p>
