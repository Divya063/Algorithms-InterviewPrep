<p>Arrays [Medium]</p>
<ul>
<li><b> Apple Stock:</b> I have an array stockPricesYesterday where the keys are the number of minutes into the day (starting with midnight) and the values are the price of Apple stock at that time. For example, the stock cost $500 at 1am, so stockPricesYesterday[60] = 500.

<li><b>Anagrams: </b>Write a method to decide if two strings are anagrams or not.
An anagram is a word formed by rearranging the letters of another word, e.g., "iceman" is an anagram of "cinema". </li>

<p>Strings [Medium]</p>
<ul>
<li><b>String Compression: </b>Implement a method to perform basic string compression using the counts of repeated characters.If the "compressed" string would not become smaller than the original string, your method should return the original string.
<code>
<br>Example: String ‘aabcccccaaa’ would become ‘a2blc5a3’
</code>
</li>
<li><b>Remove Duplicate: </b>Design an algorithm and write code to remove the duplicate characters in a string without using any additional buffer. 
NOTE: One or two additional variables are fine. An extra copy of the array is not. Write the test cases for this method.</li>

You may assume that the string has sufficient space at the end of the string to hold the additional characters, and that you are given the "true" length of the string. (Note: if implementing in Java, please use a character array so that you can perform this operation in place.)
<code>
<br>Example: Input: "Mr John Smith"
<br>Output: "Mr%20John%20Smith"
</code>
</li>
<li><b>Reverse words: </b>Given a string containing a set of words separated by whitespace transform it to a string in which the words appear in the reverse order. 
For example, “Alice likes Bob” transforms to “Bob likes Alice”. We do not need to keep the original string.</li>
<li><b>Reversing words within a String: </b>Write a function that receives a string composed by words separated by spaces and returns a string where words appear in the same order but than the original string, but every word is inverted. 
Tell the complexity of the solution.

    <br>(7+8)*{3-[5+6]*4}   - balanced parentheses
    </code>
    </li>
    <li><b>Ascending Order: </b>Write a program to sort a stack in ascending order (with biggest items on top). You may use at most one additional stack to hold items, but you may not copy the elements into any other data structure (such as an array). The stack supports the following operations: push, pop, peek, and isEmpty. </li>
    <li><b>Postfix expression: </b>Given an expression in postfix notation evaluate it. In postfix notation operands are followed by operations. For example, X+Y becomes XY+ in postfix notation.

    <br>23 17 + 45 5 - -  → 0
    </code>
    </li>

At every time interval, the player must move the head of the snake in any of the 3 directions (other than going backward), the body of the snake will move along. The game is over when the snake hits its own body or the screen boundary. Design the API and data structure to use.</li>
    <li><b>Permutations / Combinations: </b>Print all permutations of N elements in an array.

Write a recursive function that will remove all the elements in a stack and/or if you have time, write a recursive function that removes all elements in a queue.</li>
<li><b>Design a Stack using an array: </b>Develop the push | pop | peek | isEmpty functions for a stack using an array as the internal data structure.</li>
<li><b>Implement two stacks in an array: </b>Create a data structure twoStacks that represents two stacks. Implementation of twoStacks should use only one array, i.e., both stacks should use the same array for storing elements. Following functions must be supported by twoStacks. Note: Implementation of twoStack should be space efficient.
<code>
<br>push1(int x) –&gt; pushes x to first stack
<br>push2(int x) –&gt; pushes x to second stack
<br>pop1() –&gt; pops an element from first stack and return the popped element
<br>pop2() –&gt; pops an element from second stack and return the popped element
</code>
</li>
<li><b>Find the first circular tour that visits all petrol pumps: </b>Suppose there is a circle. There are n petrol pumps on that circle. You are given the amount of petrol that petrol pump will give and the distance from that petrol pump to the next petrol pump. Calculate the first point from where a truck will be able to complete the circle (The truck will stop at each petrol pump and it has infinite capacity). Expected time complexity is O(n). Assume for 1 litre petrol, the truck can go 1 unit of distance.
<code><br>
Example: let there be 4 petrol pumps with amount of petrol and distance to next petrol pump value pairs as {4, 6}, {6, 5}, {7, 3} and {4, 5}. The first point from where truck can make a circular tour is 2nd petrol pump. Output should be “start = 1″ (index of 2nd petrol pump).</code>

<div>
<p>Stacks & Queues [Medium]</p>
<ul>

<li><b>Stack with max: </b>Create a data structure that efficiently supports the stack operations (push and pop) and also a return-the-maximum operation. Assume the elements are real numbers so that you can compare them. </li>
<li><b>King and Knight: </b>Given a king and a knight on an infinite chessboard (no boundary), each takes turn to move (i.e. the king moves first, then the knight can move, then the king moves again and so on). Find the minimum number of moves until they meet at the same square. What is the time and space complexity of your solution?</li>
<li><b>Implement Peek min/max/middle on a stack: </b>Add three additional methods to a generic stack data structure. Write a peek for the min, max and middle value. This should not change the original stack. Assume all items in the stack are of the same type or have a compare function for the respective language.</li>
<li><b>Infix to Postfix Conversion: </b> Given an expression in infix notation return it in postfix notation. An infix expression is one in which operators are located between their operands. In postfix notation, the operator immediately follows its operands. ‘X + Y’ becomes ‘XY+’ in postfix notation.
<code>
<br>Example: 3+4 → 3 4 + 
<br>(300+23)*(43-21)/(84+7) → 300 23 + 43 21 - * 84 7 + /
</code>
</li>
<li><b>Topological sort: </b>Given a set of tasks and their dependency graph (i.e. edge (u, v)  means that task u depends on task v and must be completed after v; tasks can have multiple dependencies). Assume that there is no circular dependency, return an execution order of these tasks such that the dependencies are satisfied. Note: There can be many possible orders, just need to return one. The number of tasks &lt;= 10,000.
<code>
<br>Example:
<br>Input: 1 =&gt; 2; 3=&gt;1; 2 =&gt; 4; 3=&gt;4
<br>Output: 4, 2, 1, 3
</code>
</li>
<li><b>Duplicate parentheses: </b>Give an algorithm for finding duplicate parentheses in a expression.

The LRU caching scheme is to remove the least recently used frame when the cache is full and a new page is referenced which is not there in cache. </li>
<li><b>Tower of Hanoi: </b>In the classic problem of the Towers of Hanoi, you have 3 towers and N disks of different sizes which can slide onto any tower. The puzzle starts with disks sorted in ascending order of size from top to bottom (i.e., each disk sits on top of an even larger one). You have the following constraints:
<ul>
<li>Only one disk can be moved at a time.</li>
<li>A disk is slid off the top of one tower onto the next rod.</li>
<li>A disk can only be placed on top of a larger disk.</li>
