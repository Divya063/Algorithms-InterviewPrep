							<p>Arrays [Easy]</p>
							<ol>
								<li>Given an array reverse it.</li>
								<li>Write recursive and iterative versions of a binary search in an array.</li>
								<li>Given 2 arrays find an intersection of them.</li>
								<li>Given a size n array that contains all integers from 0 to n-1. The elements are in random order, how do you sort it?</li>
								<li>Write a function that accepts an n-dimension array and prints values for array of any dimension. What is the layout of multi-dimensional array in the memory?</li>
								<li>Without using a shuffle or sort write your own shuffle method for an array. The method will take an array and returns a new array with all of the elements in a random order. One important property of a good shuffle method is that every permutation is equally likely.</li>
								<li>An N sized array contains integers starting from 1. Find the first missing integer. For example, in [4, 1, 3, 2, 6] the first missing integer is 5.</li>
								<li>Shift an array by k places.</li>
								<li>Given a sorted array of 0’s and 1’s. Find out the no. of 0’s in it. Write recursive, iterative versions of the code.</li>
							<ol>
							</div>
							<div>
							<p>Arrays [Medium]</p>
							<ul>
								<li><b> Apple Stock:</b> I have an array stockPricesYesterday where the keys are the number of minutes into the day (starting with midnight) and the values are the price of Apple stock at that time. For example, the stock cost $500 at 1am, so stockPricesYesterday[60] = 500.
								Write an efficient algorithm for computing the best profit I could have made from 1 purchase and 1 sale of an Apple stock yesterday</li>

								<li><b>Pairs with given sum:</b> Given an integer array and a number k. Return all pairs of numbers that sum to k.</li>

								<li><b>Pairs with given sum 2:</b> Given two integer arrays and a number k. Return all pairs of numbers that sum to k. Each number of the pair has to be from a different array.
								Hint. What is the best space and time efficient way to do this? You should arrive at an linear algorithm.</li>

								<li><b>Kth largetst:</b> Given 2 arrays of sorted integers return the kth largest element.</li>

								<li><b>Median of Arrays: </b>There are 2 sorted arrays A and B of size n and m, respectively. Write an algorithm to find the median of the array obtained after merging the above 2 arrays(i.e. array of length n+m ). The time complexity should be O(log(n+m)).</li>

								<li><b>Matrix Rotation: </b>Given an image represented by an NxN matrix, where each pixel in the image is 4 bytes, write a method to rotate the image by 90 degrees. Can you do this in place?
								Write an algorithm such that if an element in an MxN matrix is 0, its entire row and column are set to 0.</li>

								<li><b>Kth largest 2: </b>Given an array of arrays of sorted ints. Returned the kth largest.</li>

							<ul>

							<div>
							<p>Strings [Easy]</p>
							<ul>
								<li><b>Pig Latin: </b>Write a method that takes in a string and returns the pig latin equivalent. Pig Latin takes the first consonant, moves it to the end of the word and places “ay” at the end. If the string starts with a vowel do nothing. Examples: “pig” = “igpay”, “banana” = “ananabay”.</li>

								<li><b>Reverse String: </b>Write code to reverse a C-Style String. (C-String means that “abcd” is represented as five characters, including the null character.)</li>

								<li><b>Palindrome: </b>Determine if a given string is a palindrome. A palindrome is a string that is the same forwards as backwards. For example, “abccba” and “racecar” are palindromes, “abcd” is not.</li>

								<li><b>Anagrams: </b>Write a method to decide if two strings are anagrams or not.
								An anagram is a word formed by rearranging the letters of another word, e.g., "iceman" is an anagram of "cinema". </li>

								<li><b>Finding Duplicates: </b>Find the duplicate elements in a string. 
								Hint. This is doable in linear time with a single pass. </li>
								<li><b>First non-repeated character: </b>Write an algorithm to find the first non-repeated character in a string. For example, the first non-repeated character in the string ‘abcdab’ is ‘c’.</li>

								<li><b>Adding Strings: </b>Add two strings representing real numbers. For example ""423" + "99" = "522"</p>

							<ul>
							</div>
							<div>
								<p>Strings [Medium]</p>
							<ul>
							<li><b>String Compression: </b>Implement a method to perform basic string compression using the counts of repeated characters.If the "compressed" string would not become smaller than the original string, your method should return the original string. </li>

							<code>
							Example: String ‘aabcccccaaa’ would become ‘a2blc5a3’
							</code>
							
							<li><b>Remove Duplicate: </b>Design an algorithm and write code to remove the duplicate characters in a string without using any additional buffer. 
							NOTE: One or two additional variables are fine. An extra copy of the array is not. Write the test cases for this method.</li>
					
							<li><b>Generate all permutations of a String: </b>Write a program which generates all permutations of a string. Tell the complexity of the solution.</li>

							<li><b>Unique Characters: </b>Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters. What if you cannot use additional data structures?</li>

							<li><b>Replace all spaces: </b>Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with '%20'. You may assume that the string has sufficient space at the end of the string to hold the additional characters, and that you are given the "true" length of the string. (Note: if implementing in Java, please use a character array so that you can perform this operation in place.) </li>

							<code>
								Example: Input: "Mr John Smith"
								Output: "Mr%20John%20Smith"
							</code>

							<li><b>Reverse words: </b>Given a string containing a set of words separated by whitespace transform it to a string in which the words appear in the reverse order. 
							For example, “Alice likes Bob” transforms to “Bob likes Alice”. We do not need to keep the original string.</li>

							<li><b>Reversing words within a String: </b>Write a function that receives a string composed by words separated by spaces and returns a string where words appear in the same order but than the original string, but every word is inverted. 
							Tell the complexity of the solution.</li>
							<code>
								Example: Input: "the boy ran"
								Output: "eht yob nar"
							</code>
