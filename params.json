Given an array reverse it.\r\n2. Write recursive and iterative versions of a binary search in an array.\r\n3. Given 2 arrays find an intersection of them.\r\n4. Given a size n array that contains all integers from 0 to n-1. The elements are in random order, how do you sort it?\r\n5. Write a function that accepts an n-dimension array and prints values for array of any dimension. What is the layout of multi-dimensional array in the memory?\r\n6. Without using a shuffle or sort write your own shuffle method for an array. The method will take an array and returns a new array with all of the elements in a random order. One important property of a good shuffle method is that every permutation is equally likely.\r\n7. An N sized array contains integers starting from 1. Find the first missing integer. For example, in [4, 1, 3, 2, 6]the first missing integer is 5.\r\n8. Shift an array by k places.\r\n9. Given a sorted array of 0’s and 1’s. Find out the no. of 0’s in it. Write recursive, iterative versions of the code.\r\n\r\n## Week 1 (Arrays [Medium])\r\n***\r\n####Apple Stock\r\nI have an array stockPricesYesterday where the keys are the number of minutes into the day (starting with midnight) and the values are the price of Apple stock at that time. For example, the stock cost $500 at 1am, so stockPricesYesterday[60] = 500.\r\nWrite an efficient algorithm for computing the best profit I could have made from 1 purchase and 1 sale of an Apple stock yesterday\r\n\r\n####Pairs with Given Sum, version 1\r\nGiven an integer array and a number k. Return all pairs of numbers that sum to k.\r\n\r\n####Pairs with Given Sum, version 2\r\nGiven two integer arrays and a number k. Return all pairs of numbers that sum to k. Each number of the pair has to be from a different array.\r\nHint. What is the best space and time efficient way to do this? You should arrive at an linear algorithm.\r\n\r\n####Kth Largest, version 1\r\nGiven 2 arrays of sorted integers return the kth largest element.\r\n\r\n####Median of Arrays\r\nThere are 2 sorted arrays A and B of size n and m, respectively. Write an algorithm to find the median of the array obtained after merging the above 2 arrays(i.e. array of length n+m ). The time complexity should be O(log(n+m)).\r\n\r\n####Matrix Rotation\r\nGiven an image represented by an NxN matrix, where each pixel in the image is 4 bytes, write a method to rotate the image by 90 degrees. Can you do this in place?\r\nWrite an algorithm such that if an element in an MxN matrix is 0, its entire row and column are set to 0.\r\n\r\n####Kth Largest, version 2\r\nGiven an array of arrays of sorted ints. Returned the kth largest.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Week 2 (Strings [Easy])\r\n***\r\n####Pig Latin\r\n\r\nWrite a method that takes in a string and returns the pig latin equivalent. Pig Latin takes the first consonant, moves it to the end of the word and places “ay” at the end. If the string starts with a vowel do nothing. Examples: “pig” = “igpay”, “banana” = “ananabay”.\r\n\r\n####Reverse String\r\n\r\nWrite code to reverse a C-Style String. (C-String means that “abcd” is represented as five characters, including the null character.)\r\n\r\n####Palindrome\r\n\r\nDetermine if a given string is a palindrome. A palindrome is a string that is the same forwards as backwards. For example, “abccba” and “racecar” are palindromes, “abcd” is not.\r\n\r\n####Anagrams\r\n\r\nWrite a method to decide if two strings are anagrams or not.\r\nAn anagram is a word formed by rearranging the letters of another word, e.g., \"iceman\" is an anagram of \"cinema\". \r\n\r\n####Finding Duplicates\r\n\r\nFind the duplicate elements in a string. \r\nHint. This is doable in linear time with a single pass. \r\n\r\n####First non-repeated character \r\n\r\nWrite an algorithm to find the first non-repeated character in a string. For example, the first non-repeated character in the string ‘abcdab’ is ‘c’.\r\n\r\n####Adding Strings\r\n\r\nAdd two strings representing real numbers. For example \"\"423\" + \"99\" = \"522\"\r\n\r\n## Week 2 (Strings [Medium])\r\n***\r\n####String Compression\r\nImplement a method to perform basic string compression using the counts of repeated characters.If the \"compressed\" string would not become smaller than the original string, your method should return the original string. \r\n>_Example_: \r\n>>String ‘aabcccccaaa’ would become ‘a2blc5a3’\r\n\r\n####Remove Duplicate\r\nDesign an algorithm and write code to remove the duplicate characters in a string without using any additional buffer. \r\nNOTE: One or two additional variables are fine. An extra copy of the array is not. Write the test cases for this method.\r\n\r\n####Generate all permutations of a String\r\nWrite a program which generates all permutations of a string. Tell the complexity of the solution.\r\n\r\n####Unique Characters\r\nImplement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters. What if you cannot use additional data structures?\r\n\r\n####Replace all spaces\r\nWrite a method to replace all spaces in a string with '%20'. You may assume that the string has sufficient space at the end of the string to hold the additional characters, and that you are given the \"true\" length of the string. (Note: if implementing in Java, please use a character array so that you can perform this operation in place.) \r\n>_Example_: \r\n>>Input: \"Mr John Smith\" \r\n\r\n>>Output: \"Mr%20John%20Smith\"\r\n\r\n####Reverse words\r\nGiven a string containing a set of words separated by whitespace transform it to a string in which the words appear in the reverse order. \r\nFor example, “Alice likes Bob” transforms to “Bob likes Alice”. We do not need to keep the original string.\r\n\r\n####Reversing words within a String\r\nWrite a function that receives a string composed by words separated by spaces and returns a string where words appear in the same order but than the original string, but every word is inverted. \r\nExample, for this input string\r\n@\"the boy ran\"\r\nthe output would be\r\n@\"eht yob nar\"\r\nTell the complexity of the solution.\r\n\r\n## Week 3 (Stacks and Queues [Easy])\r\n***\r\n####Balanced Parentheses\r\nWrite a function which checks if parentheses in a given expression are balanced.\r\n>_Example_: \r\n\r\n>>(5+6)*(7+8)/(4+3)   - balanced parentheses\r\n\r\n>>(4+5)*(2+(4-7)      - not balanced parentheses\r\n\r\n>>(7+8)*{3-[5+6]*4}   - balanced parentheses\r\n\r\n####Ascending Order\r\nWrite a program to sort a stack in ascending order (with biggest items on top). You may use at most one additional stack to hold items, but you may not copy the elements into any other data structure (such as an array). The stack supports the following operations: push, pop, peek, and isEmpty. \r\n\r\n####Postfix expression\r\nGiven an expression in postfix notation evaluate it. In postfix notation operands are followed by operations. For example, X+Y becomes XY+ in postfix notation.\r\n>_Example_:\t\r\n>>5 6 + \t→ \t11\r\n\r\n>>23 17 + 45 5 - - \t→\t0\r\n\r\n####Snake\r\nYou’re to write a game to paint a snake on the screen. At every time interval, the player must move the head of the snake in any of the 3 directions (other than going backward), the body of the snake will move along. The game is over when the snake hits its own body or the screen boundary. Design the API and data structure to use.\r\n\r\n\r\n####Permutations / Combinations\r\nPrint all permutations of N elements in an array.\r\nPrint all combinations of N elements in an array (each element is chosen at most once in any combination).             \r\n\r\n####Find Moving Averages and Maximums\r\nGiven an infinite stream of numbers in time order, at any given time:\r\nFind moving averages of the last K numbers.\r\nFind the maximums of the last K numbers (maybe medium problem)\r\n\r\n####Design a Queue using an array\r\nDevelop the push | pop | peek | isEmpty functions for a queue using an array as the internal data structure.\r\nRemoving all elements recursively\r\nWrite a recursive function that will remove all the elements in a stack and/or if you have time, write a recursive function that removes all elements in a queue.\r\n\r\n####Design a Stack using an array\r\nDevelop the push | pop | peek | isEmpty functions for a stack using an array as the internal data structure.\r\n \r\n####Implement two stacks in an array\r\nCreate a data structure twoStacks that represents two stacks. Implementation of twoStacks should use only one array, i.e., both stacks should use the same array for storing elements. Following functions must be supported by twoStacks.\r\n>push1(int x) –> pushes x to first stack \r\n\r\n>push2(int x) –> pushes x to second stack\r\n\r\n>pop1() –> pops an element from first stack and return the popped element\r\n\r\n>pop2() –> pops an element from second stack and return the popped element\r\n\r\nImplementation of twoStack should be space efficient.\r\n\r\n####Find the first circular tour that visits all petrol pumps\r\nSuppose there is a circle. There are n petrol pumps on that circle. You are given two sets of data.\r\n> * The amount of petrol that petrol pump will give.\r\n> * Distance from that petrol pump to the next petrol pump.\r\n\r\nCalculate the first point from where a truck will be able to complete the circle (The truck will stop at each petrol pump and it has infinite capacity). Expected time complexity is O(n). Assume for 1 litre petrol, the truck can go 1 unit of distance.\r\nFor example, let there be 4 petrol pumps with amount of petrol and distance to next petrol pump value pairs as {4, 6}, {6, 5}, {7, 3} and {4, 5}. The first point from where truck can make a circular tour is 2nd petrol pump. Output should be “start = 1″ (index of 2nd petrol pump).\r\n\r\n## Week 3 (Stacks and Queues [Medium])\r\n***\r\n\r\n####Queue with two stacks\r\nImplement a queue with two stacks so that each queue operations takes a constant amortized number of stack operations.\r\n\r\nAlternatively: design a stack using 2 queues\r\n\r\n####Stack with max\r\nCreate a data structure that efficiently supports the stack operations (push and pop) and also a return-the-maximum operation. Assume the elements are real numbers so that you can compare them. \r\n\r\n####King and Knight\r\nGiven a king and a knight on an infinite chessboard (no boundary), each takes turn to move (i.e. the king moves first, then the knight can move, then the king moves again and so on). Find the minimum number of moves until they meet at the same square. What is the time and space complexity of your solution?\r\n\r\n####Implement Peek min/max/middle on a stack\r\nAdd three additional methods to a generic stack data structure. Write a peek for the min, max and middle value. This should not change the original stack. Assume all items in the stack are of the same type or have a compare function for the respective language.\r\n\r\n####Infix to Postfix Conversion\r\nGiven an expression in infix notation return it in postfix notation. An infix expression is one in which operators are located between their operands. In postfix notation, the operator immediately follows its operands. ‘X + Y’ becomes ‘XY+’ in postfix notation.\r\n>_Example_:\t\r\n>>3+4 → 3 4 +\r\n\r\n>>(300+23)*(43-21)/(84+7) → 300 23 + 43 21 - * 84 7 + /\r\n\r\n\r\n####Topological sort\r\nGiven a set of tasks and their dependency graph (i.e. edge (u, v)  means that task u depends on task v and must be completed after v; tasks can have multiple dependencies). Assume that there is no circular dependency, return an execution order of these tasks such that the dependencies are satisfied. \r\n\r\n>_Example_: \r\n>>Input: 1 => 2; 3=>1; 2 => 4; 3=>4\r\n\r\n>>Output: 4, 2, 1, 3\r\n\r\nNote: There can be many possible orders, just need to return one. The number of tasks <= 10,000.\r\n\r\n####Duplicate parentheses\r\nGive an algorithm for finding duplicate parentheses in a expression. \r\n>_Example_:\r\n>> (( a + b ) * (( c + d ))) has duplicate parentheses around c+d\r\n\r\n>> ((a + b) + c) doesn't have duplicate parentheses\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n####Reverse a Stack using recursion\r\nYou can use only functions available with the stack push(), pop(), top(), isEmpty()\r\n\r\n####Implement LRU Cache\r\nHow to implement LRU caching scheme? What data structures should be used?\r\nWe are given total possible page numbers that can be referred. We are also given cache (or memory) size (Number of page frames that cache can hold at a time). The LRU caching scheme is to remove the least recently used frame when the cache is full and a new page is referenced which is not there in cache. \r\n\r\n####Tower of Hanoi\r\nIn the classic problem of the Towers of Hanoi, you have 3 towers and N disks of different sizes which can slide onto any tower. The puzzle starts with disks sorted in ascending order of size from top to bottom (i.e., each disk sits on top of an even larger one). You have the following constraints:\t\t\t\r\n * Only one disk can be moved at a time.\r\n\r\n * A disk is slid off the top of one tower onto the next rod.\r\n\r\n * A disk can only be placed on top of a larger disk.\r\n\r\nWrite a program to move the disks from the first tower to the last using Stacks. \r\n\r\n### Week 4\r\n\r\nMini Reviewthon \r\n\r\n### Week 5\r\nLinked Lists\r\n\r\n### Week 6\r\nBinary Trees\r\n\r\n### Week 7 \r\nDynamic Programming\r\n\r\n### Week 8\r\n\r\nMini Reviewthon ","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
