Given an array reverse it.\r\n2. Write recursive and iterative versions of a binary search in an array.\r\n3. Given 2 arrays find an intersection of them.\r\n4. Given a size n array that contains all integers from 0 to n-1. The elements are in random order, how do you sort it?\r\n5. Write a function that accepts an n-dimension array and prints values for array of any dimension. What is the layout of multi-dimensional array in the memory? [array of arrays, linearly aligned in memory http://www.fredosaurus.com/notes-cpp/arrayptr/23two-dim-array-memory-layout.html]\r\n6. Without using a shuffle or sort write your own shuffle method for an array. The method will take an array and returns a new array with all of the elements in a random order. One important property of a good shuffle method is that every permutation is equally likely.\r\n7. An N sized array contains integers starting from 1. Find the first missing integer. For example, in [4, 1, 3, 2, 6]the first missing integer is 5.\r\n8. Shift an array by k places.\r\n9. Given a sorted array of 0’s and 1’s. Find out the no. of 0’s in it. Write recursive, iterative versions of the code.\r\n\r\n[Arrays [Medium]](https://github.com/WomenWhoCode/Algorithms-InterviewPrep/blob/master/Problems/Array%20%5BMedium%5D.md)\r\n\r\n### Week 2\r\n\r\n[Strings [Easy]](https://github.com/WomenWhoCode/Algorithms-InterviewPrep/blob/master/Problems/Strings%20%5BEasy%5D.md)\r\n\r\n[Strings [Medium]](https://github.com/WomenWhoCode/Algorithms-InterviewPrep/blob/master/Problems/Strings%20%5BMedium%5D.md)\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n### Week 3\r\n\r\n[Stacks and Queues [Easy]](https://github.com/WomenWhoCode/Algorithms-InterviewPrep/blob/master/Problems/Stacks%20and%20Queues%20%5BEasy%5D.md)\r\n\r\n[Stacks and Queues [Medium]](https://github.com/WomenWhoCode/Algorithms-InterviewPrep/blob/master/Problems/Stacks%20and%20Queues%20%5BMedium%5D.md)\r\n\r\n### Week 4\r\n\r\nMini Reviewthon \r\n\r\n### Week 5\r\nLinked Lists\r\n\r\n### Week 6\r\nBinary Trees\r\n\r\n### Week 7 \r\nDynamic Programming\r\n\r\n### Week 8\r\n\r\nMini Reviewthon \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
