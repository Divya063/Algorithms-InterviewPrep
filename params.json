Given an array reverse it.\r\n2. Write recursive and iterative versions of a binary search in an array.\r\n3. Given 2 arrays find an intersection of them.\r\n4. Given a size n array that contains all integers from 0 to n-1. The elements are in random order, how do you sort it?\r\n5. Write a function that accepts an n-dimension array and prints values for array of any dimension. What is the layout of multi-dimensional array in the memory?\r\n6. Without using a shuffle or sort write your own shuffle method for an array. The method will take an array and returns a new array with all of the elements in a random order. One important property of a good shuffle method is that every permutation is equally likely.\r\n7. An N sized array contains integers starting from 1. Find the first missing integer. For example, in [4, 1, 3, 2, 6]the first missing integer is 5.\r\n8. Shift an array by k places.\r\n9. Given a sorted array of 0’s and 1’s. Find out the no. of 0’s in it. Write recursive, iterative versions of the code.\r\n\r\n###Arrays [Medium]\r\n\r\n####Apple Stock\r\nI have an array stockPricesYesterday where the keys are the number of minutes into the day (starting with midnight) and the values are the price of Apple stock at that time. For example, the stock cost $500 at 1am, so stockPricesYesterday[60] = 500.\r\nWrite an efficient algorithm for computing the best profit I could have made from 1 purchase and 1 sale of an Apple stock yesterday\r\n\r\n####Pairs with Given Sum, version 1\r\nGiven an integer array and a number k. Return all pairs of numbers that sum to k.\r\n\r\n####Pairs with Given Sum, version 2\r\nGiven two integer arrays and a number k. Return all pairs of numbers that sum to k. Each number of the pair has to be from a different array.\r\nHint. What is the best space and time efficient way to do this? You should arrive at an linear algorithm.\r\n\r\n####Kth Largest, version 1\r\nGiven 2 arrays of sorted integers return the kth largest element.\r\n\r\n####Median of Arrays\r\nThere are 2 sorted arrays A and B of size n and m, respectively. Write an algorithm to find the median of the array obtained after merging the above 2 arrays(i.e. array of length n+m ). The time complexity should be O(log(n+m)).\r\n\r\n####Matrix Rotation\r\nGiven an image represented by an NxN matrix, where each pixel in the image is 4 bytes, write a method to rotate the image by 90 degrees. Can you do this in place?\r\nWrite an algorithm such that if an element in an MxN matrix is 0, its entire row and column are set to 0.\r\n\r\n####Kth Largest, version 2\r\nGiven an array of arrays of sorted ints. Returned the kth largest.\r\n\r\n## Week 2\r\n\r\n###Strings [Easy]\r\n\r\n####Pig Latin\r\n\r\nWrite a method that takes in a string and returns the pig latin equivalent. Pig Latin takes the first consonant, moves it to the end of the word and places “ay” at the end. If the string starts with a vowel do nothing. Examples: “pig” = “igpay”, “banana” = “ananabay”.\r\n\r\n####Reverse String\r\n\r\nWrite code to reverse a C-Style String. (C-String means that “abcd” is represented as five characters, including the null character.)\r\n\r\n####Palindrome\r\n\r\nDetermine if a given string is a palindrome. A palindrome is a string that is the same forwards as backwards. For example, “abccba” and “racecar” are palindromes, “abcd” is not.\r\n\r\n####Anagrams\r\n\r\nWrite a method to decide if two strings are anagrams or not.\r\nAn anagram is a word formed by rearranging the letters of another word, e.g., \"iceman\" is an anagram of \"cinema\". \r\n\r\n####Finding Duplicates\r\n\r\nFind the duplicate elements in a string. \r\nHint. This is doable in linear time with a single pass. \r\n\r\n####First non-repeated character \r\n\r\nWrite an algorithm to find the first non-repeated character in a string. For example, the first non-repeated character in the string ‘abcdab’ is ‘c’.\r\n\r\n####Adding Strings\r\n\r\nAdd two strings representing real numbers. For example \"\"423\" + \"99\" = \"522\"\r\n\r\n[Strings [Medium]](https://github.com/WomenWhoCode/Algorithms-InterviewPrep/blob/master/Problems/Strings%20%5BMedium%5D.md)\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n### Week 3\r\n\r\n[Stacks and Queues [Easy]](https://github.com/WomenWhoCode/Algorithms-InterviewPrep/blob/master/Problems/Stacks%20and%20Queues%20%5BEasy%5D.md)\r\n\r\n[Stacks and Queues [Medium]](https://github.com/WomenWhoCode/Algorithms-InterviewPrep/blob/master/Problems/Stacks%20and%20Queues%20%5BMedium%5D.md)\r\n\r\n### Week 4\r\n\r\nMini Reviewthon \r\n\r\n### Week 5\r\nLinked Lists\r\n\r\n### Week 6\r\nBinary Trees\r\n\r\n### Week 7 \r\nDynamic Programming\r\n\r\n### Week 8\r\n\r\nMini Reviewthon ","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
