##String Problems [Easy]

######Pig Latin

Write a method that takes in a string and returns the pig latin equivalent. Pig Latin takes the first consonant, moves it to the end of the word and places “ay” at the end. If the string starts with a consonant do nothing. “pig” = “igpay”, “banana” = “ananabay”

######Reverse String

Write code to reverse a C-Style String. (C-String means that “abcd” is represented as five characters, including the null character.)

######Palindrome

Determine if a given string is a palindrome. A palindrome is a string that is the same forwards as backwards. For example, “abccba” and “racecar” are palindromes, “abcd” is not.

######Anagrams

Write a method to decide if two strings are anagrams or not.
An anagram is a word formed by rearranging the letters of another word, e.g., iceman is an anagram of cinema. 

######Finding Duplicates

Find the duplicate elements in a string. 
Hint. This is doable in linear time with a single pass. 

######First non-repeated character 

Write an algorithm to find the first non-repeated character in a string. For example, the first non-repeated character in the string ‘abcdab’ is ‘c’.


######Adding Strings

Add two strings. For example ""423" + "99" = "522"
Hint. Try to do it as efficiently as possible. Also, does it matter that it's base 10?
