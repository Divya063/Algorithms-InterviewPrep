##String Problems [Medium]

String Compression
Implement a method to perform basic string compression using the counts of repeated characters.If the "compressed" string would not become smaller than the original string, your method should return the original string. 
EXAMPLE 
String ‘aabcccccaaa’ would become ‘a2blc5a3’

Remove Duplicate
Design an algorithm and write code to remove the duplicate characters in a string without using any additional buffer. 
NOTE: One or two additional variables are fine. An extra copy of the array is not. Write the test cases for this method.

Multiplying Strings
Multiply two strings.
Hint.This one is pretty hard and it took some thinking. 
Hint2. This is slightly easier in little endian

Generate all permutations of a String (Stephanie) - Whiteboard #4
Write a program which generates all permutations of a string. Tell the complexity of the solution.

Unique Characters
 Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters. What if you cannot use additional data structures?

Replace all spaces
Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with '%20'. You may assume that the string has sufficient space at the end of the string to hold the additional characters, and that you are given the "true" length of the string. (Note: if implementing in Java, please use a character array so that you can perform this operation in place.) 
EXAMPLE 
Input: "Mr John Smith" 
Output: "Mr%20John%20Smith"
Reverse words (Yelly) - Whiteboard #7
Given a string containing a set of words separated by whitespace transform it to a string in which the words appear in the reverse order. 
For example, “Alice likes Bob” transforms to “Bob likes Alice”. We do not need to keep the original string.


Reversing words within a String

Code a function that receives a string composed by words separated by spaces and returns a string where words appear in the same order but than the original string, but every word is inverted. 
Example, for this input string
@"the boy ran"
the output would be
@"eht yob nar"
Tell the complexity of the solution.


Largest Common Substrings 
Given two strings, find the largest common substring.

Subtracting Strings 
Subtract two strings.
Hint. Slightly trickier than adding. They are still both O(n) but subtraction requires more cycles.
