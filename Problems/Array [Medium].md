##Array Problems [Medium]

__Apple Stock__
I have an array stockPricesYesterday where the keys are the number of minutes into the day (starting with midnight) and the values are the price of Apple stock at that time. For example, the stock cost $500 at 1am, so stockPricesYesterday[60] = 500.
Write an efficient algorithm for computing the best profit I could have made from 1 purchase and 1 sale of an Apple stock yesterday

__Pairs with Given Sum, version 1__
Given an integer array and a number k. Return all pairs of numbers that sum to k.

__Pairs with Given Sum, version 2__
Given two integer arrays and a number k. Return all pairs of numbers that sum to k. Each number of the pair has to be from a different array.
Hint. What is the best space and time efficient way to do this? You should arrive at an linear algorithm.

__Kth Largest, version 1__
Given 2 arrays of sorted integers return the kth largest element.

__Median of Arrays__
There are 2 sorted arrays A and B of size n and m, respectively. Write an algorithm to find the median of the array obtained after merging the above 2 arrays(i.e. array of length n+m ). The time complexity should be O(log(n+m)).

__Matrix Rotation__
Given an image represented by an NxN matrix, where each pixel in the image is 4 bytes, write a method to rotate the image by 90 degrees. Can you do this in place?
Write an algorithm such that if an element in an MxN matrix is 0, its entire row and column are set to 0.


__Kth Largest, version 2__
Given an array of arrays of sorted ints. Returned the kth largest.
