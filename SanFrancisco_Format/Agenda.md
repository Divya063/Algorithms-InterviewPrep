##Tech Interview Preparation Meetup
Solve algorithms based technical problems on white-board under a timer. This will prepare us to think on our feet and to be more comfortable during actual technical interviews.
Please arrive before 7PM so we have enough time to get introductions and walk you through the agenda of the evening. For solving medium level questions, please brush these concepts as well - Find Big-O Time and Space, Binary Search, Sorting basics, How to use Hash Tables.
