#Palindrome 2

Determine if a given string is a palindrome. A palindrome is a string that is the same forwards as backwards, ignoring letter case, punctuation marks and word dividers. For example, “racecar” and “Amor, Roma” are palindromes, “abcd” is not.

We limit the punctuation marks to ignore by the period, comma, question mark, exclamation point, apostrophe, colon, semicolon and hyphen.
