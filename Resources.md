#Excerpts from the book 'Cracking the Coding Interview'

##The interview process
Once you are selected for an interview, you usually go through a screening interview. This is typically conducted over the phone. 
Don't let the name fool you; the "screening" interview often involves coding and algorithms questions, and the bar can be just as high as it is for in-person interviews. If you're unsure whether or not the interview will be technical, ask your recruiting coordinator what position your interviewer holds. An engineer will usually perform a technical interview.

Many companies have taken advantage of online synchronized document editors, but others will expect you to write code on paper and read it back over the phone. You typically do one or two screening interviewers before being brought on-site.

In an on-site interview round, you usually have 4 to 6 in-person interviews. One of these will be over lunch.The lunch interview is usually not technical, and the interviewer may not even submit feedback. This is a good person to discuss your interests with and to ask about the company culture. Your other interviews will be mostly technical and will involve a combination of coding and algorithm questions. You should also expect some questions about your resume.

Afterwards, the interviewers meet to discuss your performance and/or submit written feedback. At most companies, your recruiter should respond to you within a week with an update on your status.
If you have waited more than a week, you should follow up with your recruiter.
