#Array Problems [Easy]

Shuffle
Without using a shuffle or sort write your own shuffle method for an array. The method will take an array and returns a new array with all of the elements in a random order. One important property of a good shuffle method is that every permutation is equally likely.
Sort Array
Given a size n array that contains all integers from 0 to n-1. The elements are in random order, how do you sort it? 
Find Missing Integer
An N sized array contains integers starting from 1. Find the first missing integer. For example, in [4, 1, 3, 2, 6] the first missing integer is 5. 
Hint. You can sort the array and find the missing number in O(n log n). How do you do better? 
Shifting Array
Shift an array by k places. 

Counting
Given a sorted array of 0’s and 1’s. Find out the no. of 0’s in it. Write recursive, iterative versions of the code. [Binary search]


Write a function that accepts an n-dimension array and prints values for array of any dimension. What is the layout of multi-dimensional array in the memory? [array of arrays, linearly aligned in memory http://www.fredosaurus.com/notes-cpp/arrayptr/23two-dim-array-memory-layout.html ]
